# Design Guidelines: Windows 11-Style Portfolio Clone

## Design Approach

**Reference-Based: Windows 11 Fluent Design System**

This portfolio website recreates the Windows 11 desktop experience as a web interface. The design draws directly from Microsoft's Fluent Design System, specifically Windows 11's aesthetic principles:
- Acrylic material effects with background blur
- Rounded corners (8px radius standard)
- Mica material for taskbar and windows
- Subtle depth through shadows and layering
- Light/dark mode support with system-aware theming
